# Zeal

## Introduction

Welcome to Zeal, a new programming language designed to combine the familiarity of C-like syntax with powerful and modern features.

## Features

- **C-Like Syntax:** Zeal adopts a syntax similar to C, making it familiar and accessible to developers with experience in C-based languages.

- **Variable Bindings:** Declare and use variables to store and manage data within your programs.

- **Data Types:** Zeal supports integers and booleans, allowing you to work with fundamental data types in your applications.

- **Arithmetic Expressions:** Perform mathematical operations using intuitive and expressive arithmetic expressions.

- **Built-in Functions:** Benefit from a set of built-in functions that enhance the language's capabilities and streamline common tasks.

- **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions:** Zeal treats functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions. This facilitates the implementation of higher-order functions.

- **Closures:** Leverage closures to encapsulate behavior within your code, providing a mechanism for maintaining state and creating modular and reusable components.

- **String Data Structure:** Manipulate and process text easily with a dedicated string data structure.

- **Array Data Structure:** Use arrays to organize and manipulate collections of data efficiently.

- **Hash Data Structure:** Employ hash data structures to implement key-value pairs for enhanced data organization and retrieval.
